            Hello, my name is Sean(Chul) Shin. 
            I'm currently a senior who is majoring in Conflict and Analysis, pursuing a degree of B.S with concentration
            on Global engagement. 
            I've initially moved to United states in my early ages, and from that experience, I was able to acquire fluentness 
            in both Korean and English. 
        </h3>
